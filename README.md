# Learning-Skill-Showcase
A collection showcasing my learning and understanding of functions and concepts of coding languages.
These files don't have much useful purpose other than demonstrating the understanding of usage of concepts and playing with said concepts.
Some files may be very small snippets I create to ensure I have properly understood a concept.
This repository is two-fold in purpose, one as a skills showcase for potential employers, and two so that later in my journey i can look back and reflect upon my growth.
Starting from almost zero as far as coding is involved, i hope this acts as a documentation of my journey as well, from the little python I know to the ability to singlehandedly creating plugins, programs, webpages and more.
To prospective employers... Please feel free to ask any questions about concepts I explore here.
