# Learning-Skill-Showcase
A collection showcasing my learning and understanding of functions and concepts of coding languages.

These files don't have much useful purpose other than demonstrating the understanding of usage of concepts and playing with said concepts.
Some files may be very small snippets I create to ensure I have properly understood a concept.

This repository is two-fold in purpose, one as a skills showcase for potential employers, and two so that later in my journey I can look back and reflect upon my growth.

Starting from almost zero as far as coding is involved, I plan for this to act as a documentation of my journey as well, from the little python I know to the ability to singlehandedly creating plugins, programs, webpages and more.

Each programming language is sorted into its own branch to facilitate organization. Nobody wants to sort through a mess of filetypes when even light organization is possible.
As I continue to expand my skills on the use of GitHub, I will further organize with the goal of neatly presenting this repository as both a timeline and skill portfolio.

To prospective employers... Please feel free to ask any questions about concepts I explore here.
Currently I am working as a professional driver for a trucking company, commits may have days to weeks between them, with multiple uploads at once.

I am also using multiple IDEs based on internet connectivity.
I use ***Visual Studio Code*** and ***PyCharm*** when I am at home and using my desktop machine, meanwhile I use ***Pydroid 3*** on the road using my chromebook.
I do plan to aquire a laptop running Windows or Linux to simplify workflow and will likely default to Visual Studio Code at that time.
