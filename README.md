## Python

This is where all the code I write using Python will be found. 
Most files here will be functional snippets that are capable of running inside an IDE or terminal interface.
As my skills progress newer code may become more complex alongside simpler proof of concept snippets.

As more complex concepts are explored, more comments may be present in code to mark a fix or explain a solution.
